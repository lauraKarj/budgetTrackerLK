## Project description:
Project name: Budget Tracker by LK

The project is a budgeting application which has been implemented with React and React Router. The application provides users tools to manage their finances effectively, including tracking income, deposits and expenses, setting income bases, budgets and saving goals. User can also see visualizations of budgets / saving goals with charts and see linear and bar plots of incomes. User can create own user for the application with username and password. User can be deleted and username and password can be changed. There isn't option to sign in or sign out.


## Methods and Tools:

**React:** Utilize React library for building user interface components and managing state.

**React Router:** React Router for handling navigation and creating routes for different sections of the application.

**Local Storage:** For storing user data.

**Chart.js:** For visualizing data using charts and graphs.

**UI and UX Elements:** Components are styled using CSS.


## Functionality

**User registration:** Allow user to create account, remove account and access their budgeting data.

**Navigation bar**: Navigate to the main page by clicking app name or edit the profile via the avatar dropdown menu.

**Budgets and saving goals:** Allow users to set financial goals with saving goals and budgets. Helps users categorize and analyze their spending habits. Budgets and saving goals can be created and deleted.

**Expenses and deposits**: Allow users to add expenses and deposits for specific budgets or saving goals. Users can view recent expenses, deposits and incomes in separate pages and delete them. Option to search expenses and deposits by budget / saving goal they belong.

**Income base and incomes**: Help users to keep up with their incomes and for example create own base for each year. Option to add, view and delete bases and incomes.

**Search menu**: Floating button offer users menu to navigate to recent pages and back to main.

**Notification features:** Alerts for budget exceedance, saving goal completion, and success or failure of requests. Implemented with Toastify.

**Data Analysis:** Analyze and visualize financial data using charts and graphs.


### Reasoning:
These project inclusions are for enhancing the functionality and user experience of the budgeting application. User authentication helps keep user data saved. Different bases and categories help users better manage their finances. Notification features improve user engagement.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
May need `npm install` before `npm start`

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
